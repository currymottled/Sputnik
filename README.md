# Sputnik
PCB soldering kit themed like Sputnik 1 space probe. Board involves 12 LED's (with pads for SMT and through hole LED's) in a charlieplexed configuration aswell as a double Op-amp (LM358P)speaker circuit integrated into a single circular PCB designed to be house in a transparent 3-d printed shell modeled after the Sputnik 1 space probe. The on-board microcontroller is the ATtiny 202 which is small and cheap aswell as able to be programmed using the UPDI interface and an Arduino as UPDI programmer.
